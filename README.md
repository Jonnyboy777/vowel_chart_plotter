Hello! If you're reading this you have stumbled upon my very cool and fun program for vowel plotting!

I'll try and make this simple, but if any questions remain feel free to email me at soell003@d.umn.edu

This program works by taking inputs from you, the user, asking for a vowel and then its corresponding F1 and F2 values, as an ordered pair

What i mean by ordered pair is just as the format "F1 F2" or "F1, F2" where F1 and F2 are replaced with their specific values from praat (without the quotes)

After inputting all the vowels you are plotting and the corresponding values, you can enter 'q' when it asks for the next vowel (you have no more to input so it makes sense to do it that way)

The program will then prompt you asking if you wish to save it to disc (your hard drive storage), if yes, then it asks the desired name (the file extension is already taken care of)

Then it displays the chart in a popup window*

*It is worth noting that you may need a little setup installing a few libraries that the program uses, which would be matplotlib. this can be intalled via terminal by use of "pip install matplotlib" as long as python is installed

Again, any further questions or thoughts can be directed to my email. I hope this is useful!
